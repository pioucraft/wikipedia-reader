Musk attended <a href="/Waterkloof House Preparatory School">Waterkloof House Preparatory School</a>, <a href="/Bryanston High School">Bryanston High School</a>, and then <a href="/Pretoria Boys High School">Pretoria Boys High School</a>, where he graduated. Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in <a href="/Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> and a B on his senior math certification. Musk applied for a Canadian passport <a href="/Jus sanguinis">through</a> his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's <a href="/Conscription in South Africa">mandatory military service</a>, which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the <a href="/University of Pretoria">University of Pretoria</a> for five months.

In 1990, he entered <a href="/Queen's University at Kingston">Queen's University</a> in <a href="/Kingston, Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a>. Two years later, he transferred to the <a href="/University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where he studied until 1995. Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a <a href="/Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> in physics and a <a href="/Bachelor of Science">Bachelor of Science</a> in economics from the university's <a href="/Wharton School">Wharton School</a>.

<h1>Business career</h1>
<h2>Zip2</h2>
In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed <a href="/Zip2">Zip2</a>. The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and <a href="/yellow pages">yellow pages</a>, and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in <a href="/Palo Alto, California">Palo Alto</a>, A <i><a href="/The Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> exposé from October 2024 reported Musk worked illegally while building the company, citing an email from Musk submitted as evidence during a 2005 defamation trial and the funding agreement from <a href="/venture capital">venture capital</a> firm Mohr Davidow Ventures. however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted. <a href="/Compaq">Compaq</a> acquired Zip2 for $307&nbsp;million in cash in February 1999, and Musk received $22&nbsp;million for his 7&nbsp;percent share.
<h2>X.com and PayPal</h2>
In March 1999, X.com was one of the first <a href="/Online banking">online banks</a> that was <a href="/Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation">federally insured</a>, and over 200,000&nbsp;customers joined in its initial months of operation.
Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as "e@x.com". Although Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with <a href="/Intuit">Intuit</a> CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.
In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank <a href="/Confinity">Confinity</a> to avoid competition, as the latter's money-transfer service <a href="/PayPal#History">PayPal</a> was more popular than X.com's service. Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for <a href="/Microsoft">Microsoft</a>- over <a href="/Unix">Unix</a>-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder <a href="/Peter Thiel">Peter Thiel</a> to resign. With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
In 2002, PayPal was acquired by <a href="/eBay">eBay</a> for $1.5&nbsp;billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176&nbsp;million. In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its "sentimental value". In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating "X, the everything app".
<h2>SpaceX</h2>
In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit <a href="/Mars Society">Mars Society</a> and discussed funding plans to place a <a href="/Space farming">growth-chamber for plants</a> on <a href="/Mars">Mars</a>. In October of the same year, he traveled to <a href="/Moscow">Moscow</a>, Russia with <a href="/Jim Cantrell">Jim Cantrell</a>, <a href="/Adeo Ressi">Adeo Ressi</a>, and future <a href="/Administrator of NASA">Administrator of NASA</a>, <a href="/Michael D. Griffin">Michael D. Griffin</a> to buy refurbished <a href="/intercontinental ballistic missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse <a href="/payload">payload</a>s into space. He met with the companies <a href="/Lavochkin">Lavochkin</a> and <a href="/ISC Kosmotras">ISC Kosmotras</a>; however, Musk was seen as a novice With $100&nbsp;million of his own money, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.
SpaceX attempted its first launch of the <a href="/Falcon 1">Falcon 1</a> rocket in 2006. Although the rocket failed to reach <a href="/Geocentric orbit">Earth orbit</a>, it was awarded a <a href="/Commercial Orbital Transportation Services">Commercial Orbital Transportation Services</a> program contract from <a href="/NASA">NASA</a>, now led by <a href="/Michael D. Griffin">Michael D. Griffin</a> as Administrator. After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt, SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008. Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6&nbsp;billion <a href="/Commercial Resupply Services">Commercial Resupply Services</a> contract from NASA for 12 flights of its <a href="/Falcon 9">Falcon 9</a> rocket and <a href="/SpaceX Dragon">Dragon spacecraft</a> to the <a href="/International Space Station">International Space Station</a> (ISS), replacing the <a href="/Space Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> after its 2011 <a href="/Space Shuttle retirement">retirement</a>. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked <a href="/SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2">with the ISS</a>, a first for a commercial spacecraft.
Working towards its goal of <a href="/SpaceX reusable launch system development program">reusable rockets</a>, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the <a href="/Multistage rocket">first stage</a> of a Falcon 9 on a land platform. Later landings were achieved on <a href="/autonomous spaceport drone ship">autonomous spaceport drone ship</a>s, an ocean-based recovery platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the <a href="/Falcon Heavy">Falcon Heavy</a>; the <a href="/Falcon Heavy test flight">inaugural mission</a> carried Musk's personal <a href="/Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster">Tesla Roadster</a> as a <a href="/boilerplate (spaceflight)">dummy payload</a>.
Since 2019, SpaceX has been developing <a href="/SpaceX Starship">Starship</a>, a <a href="/Reusable launch vehicle">reusable</a>, <a href="/super heavy-lift launch vehicle">super heavy-lift launch vehicle</a> intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the <a href="/Crew Dragon Demo-2">Demo-2</a>, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS. In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to <a href="/Atmospheric entry">deorbit</a> the ISS at the end of its lifespan.
<h2>Starlink</h2>
In 2015, SpaceX began development of the <a href="/Starlink">Starlink</a> constellation of <a href="/low Earth orbit">low Earth orbit</a> satellites to provide <a href="/satellite Internet access">satellite Internet access</a>, with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched. The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10&nbsp;billion. Some critics, including the <a href="/International Astronomical Union">International Astronomical Union</a>, have alleged that Starlink <a href="/Satellite flare">blocks the view of the sky</a> and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.
During the March 2022 <a href="/Russian invasion of Ukraine">Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>, Musk sent <a href="/Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War">Starlink terminals to Ukraine</a> to provide Internet access and communication. In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000&nbsp;satellite <a href="/Terminal (telecommunication)">terminals</a> had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80&nbsp;million. After asking the <a href="/United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine, Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400&nbsp;million. At the same time, Musk refused to block <a href="/Mass media in Russia">Russian state media</a> on Starlink, declaring himself "a <a href="/Freedom of speech">free speech</a> absolutist".
In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over <a href="/Crimea">Crimea</a> to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port <a href="/Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a>; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.
<h2>Tesla</h2>
<a href="/Tesla, Inc.">Tesla, Inc.</a>, originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by <a href="/Martin Eberhard">Martin Eberhard</a> and <a href="/Marc Tarpenning">Marc Tarpenning</a>. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the <a href="/Series A round">Series A round</a> of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35&nbsp;million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw <a href="/Tesla Roadster (first generation)">Roadster</a> product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.
Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the <a href="/2007–2008 financial crisis">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a>, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to "Technoking" while retaining his position as CEO.
Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first <a href="/mass production">mass production</a> all-electric car to use <a href="/lithium-ion battery">lithium-ion battery</a> cells. Tesla began delivery of its four-door <a href="/Tesla Model S">Model&nbsp;S</a> sedan in 2012. A <a href="/Crossover (automobile)">crossover</a>, the <a href="/Tesla Model X">Model&nbsp;X</a> was launched in 2015. A mass-market sedan, the <a href="/Tesla Model 3">Model&nbsp;3</a>, was released in 2017. In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1&nbsp;million units globally. A fifth vehicle, the <a href="/Tesla Model Y">Model&nbsp;Y</a> crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any type, as well as the all-time best-selling electric car. The <a href="/Tesla Cybertruck">Cybertruck</a>, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019, and delivered in November 2023.

<h2>SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets</h2>
In 2018, Musk was <a href="/Tesla, Inc.#Lawsuits and controversies">sued</a> by the SEC for a <a href="/Tweet (social media)">tweet</a> stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private. Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20&nbsp;million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO. Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet, and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable. Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.
In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half&nbsp;a&nbsp;million cars that year. The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him <a href="/Contempt of court">in contempt</a> for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details, including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance. In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high <a href="/List of acronyms: I">imo</a>") violated the agreement. <a href="/Freedom of Information Act (United States)">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "<a href="/Tesla Energy">Tesla's solar roof</a> production volumes and its stock price".
<h2>SolarCity and Tesla Energy</h2>
Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for <a href="/SolarCity">SolarCity</a>, which his cousins <a href="/Lyndon Rive">Lyndon</a> and Peter Rive founded in 2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in <a href="/Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a>, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States. Construction of the <a href="/Gigafactory New York">factory</a> started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with <a href="/Panasonic">Panasonic</a> until early 2020.
Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2&nbsp;billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create <a href="/Tesla Energy">Tesla Energy</a>. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders. Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant. Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.
<h2>Neuralink</h2>
In 2016, Musk co-founded <a href="/Neuralink">Neuralink</a>, a <a href="/neurotechnology">neurotechnology</a> startup company, with an investment of $100&nbsp;million. The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as <a href="/Alzheimer's disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="/dementia">dementia</a>, and <a href="/Spinal cord injury">spinal cord injuries</a>.
In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a <a href="/sewing machine">sewing machine</a> that could embed threads into a human brain. In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research, Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers. At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as "a <a href="/Fitbit">Fitbit</a> in your skull" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims, with <i><a href="/MIT Technology Review">MIT Technology Review</a></i> describing them as "highly speculative" and "neuroscience theater". During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.
Neuralink has conducted further <a href="/animal testing">animal testing</a> on <a href="/Macaque">macaque monkeys</a> at the <a href="/University of California, Davis">University of California, Davis</a>' <a href="/California National Primate Research Center">Primate Research Center</a>. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game <a href="/Pong">Pong</a> via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of <a href="/Cruelty to animals">animal cruelty</a>. The <a href="/Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine">Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine</a> has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the <a href="/Animal Welfare Act of 1966">Animal Welfare Act</a>. Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink. In September 2023, the <a href="/Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.
<h2>The Boring Company</h2>
In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to  and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities. Early in 2017, the company began discussions with <a href="/regulatory agency">regulatory bodies</a> and initiated construction of a  wide,  long, and  deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits. The <a href="/Boring test tunnel">Los Angeles tunnel</a>, less than  in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model&nbsp;Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.
Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled. However, a tunnel beneath the <a href="/Las Vegas Convention Center">Las Vegas Convention Center</a> was completed in early 2021. Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. 
<h2> Twitter / X </h2>
Musk expressed interest in buying <a href="/Twitter, Inc.">Twitter</a> as early as 2017, and had questioned the platform's commitment to <a href="/freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>. Additionally, his ex-wife <a href="/Talulah Riley">Talulah Riley</a> had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the "<a href="/woke">woke</a>-ism". In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April, making him the largest shareholder. When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 <a href="/initial public offering">initial public offering</a>. On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company. However, on April 13, Musk made a $43&nbsp;billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20&nbsp;per&nbsp;share. In response, Twitter's board adopted a "poison pill" <a href="/shareholder rights plan">shareholder rights plan</a> to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval. Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44&nbsp;billion. This included about $12.5&nbsp;billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21&nbsp;billion in <a href="/Equity (finance)">equity financing</a>.
Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100&nbsp;billion the next day in reaction to the deal. He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive <a href="/Vijaya Gadde">Vijaya Gadde</a>'s policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her. Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was "on hold" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts. Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition, he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's board of directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction. On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the <a href="/Delaware Court of Chancery">Delaware Court of Chancery</a> for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter. In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20&nbsp;per&nbsp;share. The acquisition was officially completed on October 27. Musk became the CEO instead. He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a "<a href="/Twitter verification">blue check</a>", and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff. Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like <i><a href="/The Babylon Bee">The Babylon Bee</a></i>. The <a href="/Southern Poverty Law Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists; hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.
In December 2022, Musk released <a href="/Twitter Files">internal documents</a> relating to Twitter's moderation of <a href="/Hunter Biden laptop controversy">Hunter Biden's laptop controversy</a> in the lead-up to the <a href="/2020 United States presidential election">2020 presidential election</a>. Comments on these internal documents by journalists <a href="/Matt Taibbi">Matt Taibbi</a>, <a href="/Bari Weiss">Bari Weiss</a>, <a href="/Michael Shellenberger">Michael Shellenberger</a> and others were posted on Twitter as the <a href="/Twitter Files">Twitter Files</a>. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed that the <a href="/Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a <i><a href="/New York Post">New York Post</a></i> story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing. The <a href="/United States House Committee on the Judiciary">United States House Committee on the Judiciary</a> held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.
In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so. Five months later, Musk stepped down from <a href="/chief executive officer">chief executive officer</a> (CEO) and placed former <a href="/NBCUniversal">NBCUniversal</a> executive <a href="/Linda Yaccarino">Linda Yaccarino</a> in the position and transitioned his role to <a href="/Chair (officer)">executive chairman</a> and <a href="/chief technology officer">chief technology officer</a> (CTO).
On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that <a href="/Media Matters for America">Media Matters for America</a> "manipulated" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and "resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.
<i><a href="/The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> reported in August 2024 that the $13&nbsp;billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter "is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the <a href="/2007–2008 financial crisis">2008 to '09 financial crisis</a>", adding that "the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan" but "you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan". <i>The Washington Post</i> reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, "a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals". Two years after the acquisition, <a href="/Fidelity Investments">Fidelity Investments</a> estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.
<h2>Leadership style</h2>
Musk is often described as a <a href="/Micromanagement">micromanager</a> and has called himself a "nano-manager". <i>The New York Times</i> has characterized his approach as <a href="/Autocracy">autocratic</a>. He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from <a href="/Tesla Autopilot">Tesla Autopilot</a>. His insistence on <a href="/vertical integration">vertical integration</a> causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket, vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software. Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week. He has his new employees sign strict <a href="/non-disclosure agreement">non-disclosure agreement</a>s and often fires in sprees, That same month, he suspended <a href="/remote work">remote work</a> at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office. He laid off more than 10&nbsp;percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024.
Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors, <i><a href="/The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as "self-driving", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer "lives at risk", with some employees resigning in 2017 in consequence.
<h1>Other activities</h1>
<h2>Musk Foundation</h2>
Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001, whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, <a href="/pediatrics">pediatrics</a>, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and support science and engineering educational efforts. 
As of 2020, the foundation had made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the <a href="/Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit <a href="/Big Green (non-profit company)">Big Green</a>. From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25&nbsp;million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI, which was a nonprofit at the time. The Foundation also allocated $100&nbsp;million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.
In 2012, Musk took <a href="/the Giving Pledge">the Giving Pledge</a>, thereby committing to give the majority of <a href="/#Wealth">his wealth</a> to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will. He has endowed prizes at the <a href="/Xprize Foundation">Xprize Foundation</a>, including $100&nbsp;million to reward improved <a href="/Carbon sequestration">carbon capture</a> technology. 
<i><a href="/Vox (website)">Vox</a></i> said in February 2021, "the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text. However, <a href="/Bloomberg News">Bloomberg News</a> noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4&nbsp;billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160&nbsp;million to nonprofits that year. Reporting by <i>The New York Times</i> found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230&nbsp;million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.
<h2>Hyperloop</h2>
In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a <a href="/vactrain">vactrain</a> and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs. Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop. The <a href="/Software release life cycle#Alpha">alpha</a> design for the system was published in a <a href="/white paper">white paper</a> posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs. The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between <a href="/Greater Los Angeles">Greater Los Angeles</a> and the <a href="/San Francisco Bay Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>, at an estimated cost of $6&nbsp;billion. The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other <a href="/mode of transport">mode of transport</a> for such long distances. Biographer <a href="/Ashlee Vance">Ashlee Vance</a> noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would "make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train" proposal current in California at the time and consider more "creative" ideas.
In 2015, Musk announced a <a href="/Inducement prize contest">design competition</a> for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with <a href="/Hawthorne Municipal Airport (California)">Hawthorne Municipal Airport</a> as its destination. In July 2017, Musk said that he had received "verbal government approval" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in <a href="/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="/Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. Mention of the projected <a href="/Washington, D.C.">DC</a>-to-Baltimore leg was removed from the Boring Company website in 2021. The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.
Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs. Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said, "It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision."
<h2>OpenAI and xAI</h2>
In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a <a href="/Nonprofit corporation">not-for-profit</a> <a href="/artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) research company aiming to develop <a href="/artificial general intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a> intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity. A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial <a href="/superintelligence">superintelligence</a> systems, against governments and corporations. In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100&nbsp;million to OpenAI. <a href="/TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, "only $15&nbsp;million" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50&nbsp;million.
In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through <a href="/Tesla Autopilot">Tesla Autopilot</a>. Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing <a href="/neural network">neural network</a>s such as <a href="/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a> (producing human-like text) and <a href="/DALL-E">DALL-E</a> (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).
On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called <a href="/xAI (company)">xAI</a>, which aims to develop a <a href="/generative artificial intelligence">generative AI</a> program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI. Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.
On February 29, 2024, Musk sued <a href="/OpenAI">OpenAI</a>, its Chief Executive <a href="/Sam Altman">Sam Altman</a>, and its President <a href="/Greg Brockman">Greg Brockman</a>. He accused the company of violating its founding agreement by prioritizing profits over AI safety.
<h2>Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case</h2>
In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of <a href="/Tham Luang cave rescue">children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand</a>. Engineers at SpaceX and the Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand. Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it was not practical for the rescue mission. In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the <a href="/Vajiralongkorn">King of Thailand</a> for involvement in the rescue effort.
Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on <a href="/CNN">CNN</a> as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk "had no conception of what the cave passage was like" and "can stick his submarine where it hurts". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a "pedo guy". He then deleted the tweets, and deleted his responses to critical tweets from <a href="/Cher Scarlett">Cher Scarlett</a>, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her. In an email to <i><a href="/BuzzFeed News">BuzzFeed News</a></i>, Musk later called Unsworth a "child rapist" and said that he had married a child.
In September, Unsworth filed a <a href="/defamation">defamation</a> suit seeking $190&nbsp;million in damages. In his defense, Musk argued that pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up&nbsp;... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor."
<h2>2018 cannabis incident</h2>
In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on <i><a href="/The Joe Rogan Experience">The Joe Rogan Experience</a></i> podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a <a href="/Joint (cannabis)">joint</a>. In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the <a href="/Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988">Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988</a> for federal contractors. In a 2019 <i><a href="/60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> interview, Musk had said, "I do not smoke <a href="/Cannabis (drug)">pot</a>. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot."
<h2>Music</h2>
In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, "<a href="/Rest in peace">RIP</a> Harambe", on <a href="/SoundCloud">SoundCloud</a>. The track refers to the killing of <a href="/Harambe">Harambe</a> the gorilla and the subsequent <a href="/Viral phenomenon">Internet sensationalism</a> surrounding the event. The following year, Musk released an <a href="/Electronic dance music">EDM</a> track, "Don't Doubt Ur Vibe", featuring his own lyrics and vocals. While <i><a href="/The Guardian">Guardian</a></i> critic <a href="/Alexis Petridis">Alexi Petridis</a> described it as "indistinguishable&nbsp;... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud", <a href="/TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> said it was "not a bad representation of the genre". His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent <a href="/fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> usage have received criticism. Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through <a href="/ElonJet">ElonJet</a>. After Musk said that his son  had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed, Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including <a href="/Donie O'Sullivan (journalist)">Donie O'Sullivan</a>, <a href="/Keith Olbermann">Keith Olbermann</a>, and journalists from <i><a href="/The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, <i><a href="/The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i>, <i><a href="/CNN">CNN</a></i>, and <i><a href="/The Intercept">The Intercept</a>.</i> Musk equated the reporting to <a href="/doxing">doxxing</a>. Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker. Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.
<h2> Company towns </h2>
After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5&nbsp;billion. The project to build the <a href="/company town">company town</a> named <a href="/Snailbrook, Texas">Snailbrook</a> in <a href="/Bastrop County, Texas">Bastrop County, Texas</a> began in 2021 according to reports by <i><a href="/The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i>. Musk's then-girlfriend <a href="/Grimes">Grimes</a> and <a href="/Kanye West">Kanye West</a> were involved in the planning. There are plans to establish a school and a university there.
Musk is the <a href="/The World's Billionaires">wealthiest person in the world</a>; as of January 2025, his estimated <a href="/net worth">net worth</a> is $426 billion according to the <i><a href="/Bloomberg Billionaires Index">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a></i>, and $416&nbsp;billion according to <i><a href="/Forbes">Forbes</a></i>, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.
<h1>   Personal actions, views, and social media usage</h1>
Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly <a href="/Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, <a href="/Grok (chatbot)">Grok</a>, and his <a href="/Libertarianism in the United States">libertarian</a> inclinations. Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009, Musk has been an active user and has over 163&nbsp;million followers . He posts <a href="/Internet meme">memes</a>, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues. Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking <a href="/Preferred gender pronoun">preferred gender pronouns</a>, comparing Canadian prime minister <a href="/Justin Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> to <a href="/Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, endorsing the far-right German <a href="/Alternative for Germany">Alternative for Germany</a> (AfD) party, and calling for British far-right activist <a href="/Tommy Robinson">Tommy Robinson</a> to be released from prison. 
<i>The New York Times</i> describes his contributions to international relations as "chaotic", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests. As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer <a href="/2023 Allen, Texas mall shooting">Mauricio Garcia</a>'s apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a <a href="/Psychological warfare">psyop</a>. Some have alleged he is <a href="/Transphobia">transphobic</a> in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.
<h2>Finance</h2>
Musk said that the US government should not provide <a href="/Subsidy">subsidies</a> to companies, but impose a <a href="/carbon tax">carbon tax</a> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The <a href="/free market">free market</a>, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences. 
Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies. As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9&nbsp;billion from government-initiated systems of <a href="/Carbon offsets and credits">zero-emissions credits</a>. <a href="/Tax credit">Tax credit</a>s <a href="/Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#Automobile tax reductions">offered</a> in California, at the <a href="/Plug-in electric vehicles in the United States#Government support">United States federal level</a>, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's <a href="/battery electric vehicle">battery electric vehicle</a>s to be price-competitive in comparison with <a href="/internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a> vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles. 
Musk, a longtime opponent of <a href="/Short (finance)">short-selling</a>, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal. <i><a href="/Wired (magazine)">Wired</a></i> magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies. In early 2021, he encouraged the <a href="/GameStop short squeeze">GameStop short squeeze</a>.
In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6&nbsp;billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22&nbsp;million shares in the company, despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.
<h2>Technology</h2>
Musk has promoted <a href="/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrencies</a> and supports them over traditional <a href="/Fiat money">government-issued fiat currencies</a>. Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets, his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as <a href="/market manipulation">market manipulation</a> by some, such as economist <a href="/Nouriel Roubini">Nouriel Roubini</a>. Musk's social media praising of <a href="/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="/Dogecoin">Dogecoin</a> was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5&nbsp;billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions. Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the <a href="/Environmental impact of bitcoin">environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining</a>. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.
Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles). His comments have been called "elitist" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and <a href="/urban planning">urban planning</a> experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense <a href="/urban areas">urban areas</a> is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars. Accordingly, Musk has stated that <a href="/Existential risk from artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI) poses the greatest existential threat to humanity</a>. He has warned of a "<a href="/Terminator (franchise)">Terminator</a>-like" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development. In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with <a href="/Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> and hundreds of others, of the <a href="/Open letter on artificial intelligence (2015)">open letter on artificial intelligence</a>, which called for the ban of <a href="/Lethal autonomous weapon">lethal autonomous weapons</a>. Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist <a href="/Yann LeCun">Yann LeCun</a> and <a href="/Meta Platforms">Meta Platforms</a> CEO <a href="/Mark Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. The think tank <a href="/Information Technology and Innovation Foundation">Information Technology and Innovation Foundation</a> awarded Musk its Annual <a href="/Luddite#Modern usage">Luddite</a> Award in 2016.
Musk has described <a href="/climate change">climate change</a> as the greatest threat to humanity after AI, and has advocated for a <a href="/carbon tax">carbon tax</a>. Musk was a critic of President <a href="/Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a>'s stance on climate change, and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to <a href="/United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement">withdraw the United States</a> from the <a href="/Paris Agreement">Paris Agreement</a>. In 2021, Musk donated $100&nbsp;million to fund a competition for new carbon removal ideas. However, Musk's lifestyle has been criticized for high <a href="/greenhouse gas emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and SpaceX has been found violating <a href="/Environmental law">environmental regulations</a> by repeatedly <a href="/Water pollution">polluting waters</a> in Texas. In an interview with Trump in August 2024, in the lead-up to the <a href="/2024 United States presidential election">2024 United States presidential election</a>, Musk tried to educate Trump on climate change, but chose not to challenge Trump's <a href="/Climate change denial">dismissive remarks on the issue</a>. In the same interview, Musk stated that the economy would collapse without oil and gas, repeating previous statements that it was wrong to "vilify" the oil and gas industries.
Musk <a href="/SpaceX Mars colonization program">has long promoted the colonization of Mars</a> and argues that humanity should become a "<a href="/Space and survival">multiplanetary species</a>". He has suggested the use of <a href="/Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> to <a href="/Terraforming of Mars">terraform Mars</a>. He envisioned establishing a <a href="/direct democracy">direct democracy</a> on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them. Musk has also voiced concerns about human <a href="/population decline">population decline</a>, saying that, "Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization." Speaking at <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>s CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining <a href="/birth rate">birth rate</a>, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest <a href="/Global catastrophic risk">risks to human civilization</a>. According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with <i>The New York Times</i>, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars. He has denied this claim.
<h2>Politics</h2>
Musk is an outlier among executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump. He was his largest individual <a href="/Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign">2024 presidential campaign</a> donor and largest individual donor of the 2024 election. 
While previously considered relatively <a href="/Apoliticism">apolitical</a> and <a href="/Political moderate">moderate</a>, Musk has shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022, and his views are now generally described as right-wing and conservative. He has shared far-right misinformation and numerous <a href="/Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theories</a>. Despite this, he still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.  
Musk was a registered <a href="/independent voter">independent voter</a> when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both <a href="/Democratic Party (United States)">Democrats</a> and <a href="/Republican Party (United States)">Republicans</a>, many of whom serve in states in which he has a vested interest. Beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.
Musk voted for <a href="/Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> in the <a href="/2016 US presidential election">2016 US presidential election</a>.

That fall he gave over $50&nbsp;million to <a href="/Citizens for Sanity">Citizens for Sanity</a>, a conservative <a href="/political action committee">political action committee</a> that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration. He supported Republican <a href="/Ron DeSantis">Ron DeSantis</a> for the <a href="/2024 US presidential election">2024 US presidential election</a>, giving $10&nbsp;million to the campaign in 2023, In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate <a href="/Vivek Ramaswamy">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.
After the <a href="/Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania">attempted assassination of Donald Trump</a>, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and <a href="/List of Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign endorsements">endorsed him for president</a>. In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a <a href="/deepfake">deepfake</a> video of Vice President <a href="/Kamala Harris">Kamala Harris</a>, Trump's opponent in the <a href="/2024 United States presidential election">2024 presidential election</a>, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the "ultimate diversity hire" and did not know how to manage the United States. Musk wrote that the video was "amazing" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting "synthetic, manipulated" content "that may deceive". Trump said he would "love" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the <a href="/US Department of Education">Department of Education</a>. but the <a href="/United States Secret Service">United States Secret Service</a> said it was opening a probe. 
In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally. In November 2024, news media described how Musk was "sharing and posting demonstrably false anti-Harris disinformation to his 200 million followers" and immigration in support of Trump. 
After becoming president-elect, Trump announced that Musk and <a href="/Vivek Ramaswamy">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> would run a new <a href="/Department of Government Efficiency">Department of Government Efficiency</a>, and advisory commission to the President. Musk was described as derailing a December 2024 <a href="/Continuing resolution">continuing resolution bill</a> to fund the government by posting numerous false and misleading claims about the bill's content on his X account, including false claims of it funding <a href="/bioweapons">bioweapons</a> labs and requiring <a href="/vaccine mandates">vaccine mandates</a>.
Musk opposes a "<a href="/Wealth tax">billionaire tax</a>", and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as <a href="/Bernie Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="/Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, and <a href="/Elizabeth Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>. He has criticised the <a href="/Black Lives Matter">Black Lives Matter</a> protests, particularly regarding the authenticity of the phrase "<a href="/Hands up, don't shoot">Hands up, don't shoot</a>". Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the <a href="/Attack on Paul Pelosi">attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband</a>, but later deleted the tweet. He also used X to spread disinformation and election conspiracy theories about the <a href="/Federal Emergency Management Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>'s relief efforts for <a href="/Hurricane Helene">Hurricane Helene</a>. Georgia Secretary of State <a href="/Brad Raffensperger">Brad Raffensperger</a> requested that X remove a fabricated video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant who had voted multiple times. Musk complied, but the video had already gone viral.
<h2>Government advisory roles</h2>
US president-elect <a href="/Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> announced on November 12, 2024 that Musk would become an inaugural leader of the <a href="/Department of Government Efficiency">Department of Government Efficiency</a> (DOGE), a governmental advisory body that will "slash excess regulations [and] cut wasteful expenditures". <a href="/Vivek Ramaswamy">Vivek Ramaswamy</a> would be tasked with leading the department alongside Musk.
In December 2024, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy expressed support for <a href="/H-1B visa">H-1B visa</a>, which allows the hiring of highly-skilled foreign workers, especially by the technology companies in the United States, while some far-right activists such as <a href="/Laura Loomer">Laura Loomer</a> opposed it on X. The controversy started when Laura Loomer criticized a Trump appointee's previous support for removing some caps on <a href="/Green card">green cards</a> of skilled foreign workers in United States.
<h2> Conservative PAC activities </h2>
In 2022, Musk provided over $50&nbsp;million to fund <a href="/Citizens for Sanity">Citizens for Sanity</a>, a conservative <a href="/political action committee">political action committee</a> (PAC) created by former Trump senior advisor <a href="/Stephen Miller (political advisor)">Steven Miller</a> to finance $93&nbsp;million in advertisements related to <a href="/culture war">culture war</a> issues. <i><a href="/The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and <a href="/OpenSecrets">OpenSecrets</a> reported in October 2024 that some of Musk's donations were routed through <a href="/Building America's Future">Building America's Future</a>, a non-profit organization and the hub of a <a href="/dark money">dark money</a> network supporting Trump. The organization created "<a href="/Building America's Future#Progress 2028">Progress 2028</a>", which promoted misinformation about the agenda of Democratic presidential candidate Harris, and was presented as the left's response to <a href="/Project 2025">Project 2025</a>,  Musk has also promoted the Fair Election Fund, which is heavily funded by Building America's Future, and offers rewards for evidence of election fraud. That organization is heavily involved in <a href="/America PAC">America PAC</a>, which is founded and funded exclusively by Musk. In October 2024, a <a href="/Federal Election Commission">Federal Election Commission</a> filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75&nbsp;million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72&nbsp;million to support Trump's campaign. 
In October 2024, Musk promoted a <a href="/Sweepstake">sweepstakes</a> conducted by his America PAC, offering to pay $1&nbsp;million per day to randomly selected registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition pledging support of the <a href="/First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First</a> and <a href="/Second Amendment to the United States Constitution">Second Amendments</a>. Within days the <a href="/U.S. Justice Department">U.S. Justice Department</a> wrote America PAC warning that the sweepstakes might be illegal. Compensating people to register to vote violates federal law, and although registering to vote was not a condition to signing the petition, some legal analysts said the sweepstakes might induce people to register in order to participate. Musk's defenders said signing the petition did not specifically induce people to register, although he had previously said registering voters was one of his goals in Pennsylvania and had begun describing prize winners as America PAC "spokespeople". After receiving the Justice Department's warning, Musk awarded two people $1&nbsp;million each. On October 28, Philadelphia District Attorney <a href="/Larry Krasner">Larry Krasner</a>, sued Musk and America PAC. Although Musk had originally said that the prize would be "randomly" awarded, his lawyer argued that recipients "earn" the money after being "selected based on their suitability to serve as spokesperson for America PAC". After an all-day hearing on November 4, the day before Election Day, the judge ruled that Musk could continue his daily giveaway.
On October 16, 2024, Musk created and contributed $20.5 million as the sole donor to an "<a href="/RBG PAC">RBG PAC</a>" that used the initials and name of former Supreme Court Justice <a href="/Ruth Bader Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> to try to convince voters that Trump would not sign a national abortion ban. The PAC was formed the day after it would be required to disclose its donors before the election.
On December 6, 2024, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported that Musk had donated $277 million to Trump and allied Republicans, making him the single largest individual political donor in the 2024 election and the largest donor since at least 2010, not counting candidates who funded their own campaigns, according to data from OpenSecrets. <i>The Post</i> described Musk as being referred to by some Republicans as "the <a href="/George Soros">Soros</a> of the right". and has been sometimes accused internationally of spreading <a href="/Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theories</a> and <a href="/misinformation">misinformation</a>. He frequently shares his political views on international politics through his social media company X.
Musk's international political activity has come under increasing scrutiny, especially in Europe, due to his position in the incoming <a href="/Second Trump administration">US Government</a>, with some saying his actions and comments appear as "foreign interference" in domestic affairs. Musk's comments and actions have received increasing criticism from the Governments and Leaders of the <a href="/Government of the United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="/Government of France">France</a>, <a href="/Council of State (Norway)">Norway</a>, <a href="/Spanish government departments">Spain</a> and <a href="/Cabinet of Germany">Germany</a>.
<h2> United Kingdom </h2>
In November 2023, Musk restored far-right UK activist <a href="/Tommy Robinson">Tommy Robinson</a>'s account on X (Twitter), which had been banned under Twitter's previous owners. In August 2024, Musk responded to Robinson's post criticizing UK Prime Minister <a href="/Keir Starmer">Keir Starmer</a> about <a href="/2024 United Kingdom riots">the riots taking place in the UK.</a> Musk later said, "Shouldn't you [Starmer] be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?" Musk responded to a tweet that the riots were due to the "effects of mass migration and open borders", with "Civil war is inevitable." Starmer's spokesman responded there is "no justification for comments like that". Musk went on to refer to the Prime Minister as "two-tier Keir". Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainment camps in the <a href="/Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> to hold rioters. 
In November 2024, Musk wrote that Britain was "going full <a href="/Joseph Stalin">Stalin</a>" following the government's decision to end the <a href="/Inheritance tax in the United Kingdom">inheritance tax</a> exemption on agricultural assets worth more than £1&nbsp;million. 
In December 2024, <a href="/The London Evening Standard"><i>The Standard</i></a> reported that Musk was planning to donate $100&nbsp;million to <a href="/Nigel Farage">Nigel Farage</a>'s <a href="/Reform UK">Reform UK</a> party ahead of the next UK election, aiming to help Farage become Prime Minister, and may route the funds through X's UK branch to bypass donation laws. The following month, Musk called for a new election in the UK, saying "only Reform can save Britain". Musk also called for Robinson to be released from prison, following his sentencing in October 2024 for <a href="/contempt of court">contempt of court</a>. Musk then called for the resignation of Farage as leader of Reform UK for not having "what it takes".
In January 2025, Musk criticized the UK government over its refusal for a public inquiry into the child abuse scandals in northern UK towns such as <a href="/Oldham Council#ExploitationScandal">Oldham</a> and <a href="/Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal">Rotherham</a>, where many young girls were exploited by "grooming gangs" of adult men. Musk called for minister <a href="/Jess Phillips">Jess Phillips</a> to be jailed and said she is a "rape genocide apologist", when Phillips denied requests for a national government inquiry and instead suggested that the local <a href="/Oldham Council">Oldham Council</a> may commission an inquiry. Minister <a href="/Wes Streeting">Wes Streeting</a> responded that Musk's comments were "misjudged and certainly misinformed". Musk further claimed that Phillips was a hypocrite, since she had called <a href="/Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)">member of parliament</a> <a href="/George Galloway">George Galloway</a> "a rape apologist" when he had questioned the rape accusation against <a href="/Julian Assange">Julian Assange</a>. 
Musk also called for Prime Minister Starmer to be arrested for his record as a former top national prosecutor during the child abuse scandals. Musk posted a poll on X asking whether the U.S. should "liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government". Musk's comments were condemned by Starmer. <a href="/Liberal Democrats (UK)">Liberal Democrat</a> leader <a href="/Ed Davey">Ed Davey</a> called for the UK government to summon the <a href="/List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom">US ambassador</a> over the "interfering" comments, due to Musk's position in the incoming <a href="/Federal government of the United States">US government</a>. On <a href="/Broadcasting House (radio programme)"><i>Broadcasting House</i></a>, <a href="/Neil Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a> urged politicians from all parties to unite against Musk, warning that his increasing power, particularly with his role in the Trump administration, posed a threat to the UK.
<h2> Germany </h2>
In December 2024, Musk endorsed the German far-right <a href="/Alternative for Germany">AfD</a> party, stating "Only the AfD can save Germany" on his X account. The endorsement came after previous comments Musk posted in June 2024 where he stated he did not believe AfD's policies were far-right and criticized German Chancellor <a href="/Olaf Scholz">Olaf Scholz</a>, calling him a "fool". Following the revelation that the suspect in the <a href="/2024 Magdeburg car attack">2024 Magdeburg car attack</a> was a far-right, anti-Islam advocate who had praised Musk and the AfD, Musk tweeted that suspect's atheism was a "scam to avoid extradition". Later that month, Musk penned an <a href="/op-ed">op-ed</a> supporting the AfD in <i><a href="/Die Welt">Die Welt</a></i>. 
In his 2025 new year address to the German people, Chancellor Scholz, appeared to criticise Musk's political activity relating to Germany on X saying that the <a href="/2025 German federal election">federal election</a> will be decided by the German people and "Will not be decided by the owners of social media channels."
On 3 January 2025, Musk announced he would be hosting a livestream with AfD leader <a href="/Alice Weidel">Alice Weidel</a>, which would be held on X, ahead of the federal elections. The proposed livestream has caused backlash from German political leaders who have argued it could be <a href="/Foreign electoral intervention">election interference</a>. Musk's position as a member of the incoming <a href="/Second presidency of Donald Trump">Trump Administration</a> lead to <a href="/Rolf Mützenich">Rolf Mützenich</a>, leader of the <a href="/Social Democratic Party of Germany">SDP</a> in the <a href="/Bundestag">Bundestag</a> to make a statement in which he asked if the "interference in the election campaign were also expressed in the name of the new US government." The <a href="/European Commission">European Commission</a> announced that the interview would be analysed to assess whether it adheres to EU Law, ensuring the platform does not give any political party preferential treatment, and could potentially impact the ongoing investigation of Musk's X, for breaches of the EU <a href="/Digital Services Act">Digital Services Act</a>, which aims to combat misinformation on digital platforms and promote transparency of social media practices.
<h2> Israel </h2>
In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized <a href="/2023 Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip">Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip</a> during the <a href="/2023 Israel–Hamas war">Israel–Hamas war</a>, saying that <a href="/Hamas">Hamas</a> "wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel". He added that, "if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli." On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as "<a href="/decolonization">decolonization</a>" and "<a href="/from the river to the sea">from the river to the sea</a>", or similar expressions that "necessarily imply <a href="/genocide">genocide</a>" of the <a href="/Jewish people">Jewish people</a> in Israel, will be suspended. Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel where he toured with Israeli prime minister <a href="/Benjamin Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> the <a href="/kibbutz">kibbutz</a> <a href="/Kfar Aza">Kfar Aza</a>, site of <a href="/Kfar Aza massacre">one of the worst atrocities</a> during the <a href="/2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel">2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel</a>. He described the experience as "jarring".
<h2> China </h2>
Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla. After <a href="/Gigafactory Shanghai">Gigafactory Shanghai</a> produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people. In 2022, Musk wrote an article for <i>China Cyberspace</i>, the official publication of <a href="/Cyberspace Administration of China">Cyberspace Administration of China</a>, which enforces <a href="/Internet censorship in China">Internet censorship in China</a>. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech. Musk later advocated for <a href="/Taiwan">Taiwan</a> to become a "<a href="/One country, two systems">special administrative zone</a>" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.
<h2> Russia </h2>
In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and "peace plan" to resolve the <a href="/2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine">Russian invasion of Ukraine</a> by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO. It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian president <a href="/Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> prior to the proposal, which Musk denied. Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of <a href="/nuclear weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s and the outbreak of <a href="/World War III">World War III</a>.
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported in October 2024 that Musk had been in regular contact with <a href="/Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, <a href="/Sergey Kiriyenko">Sergey Kiriyenko</a>, and other high ranking Russian government officials since late 2022, discussing personal topics, business and geopolitical matters. The Kremlin denied the report, stating Musk and Putin had spoken only once. The <i>Journal</i> reported that in one instance Putin had asked Musk to avoid activating his Starlink satellite system over <a href="/Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, to appease <a href="/President of China">Chinese president</a> <a href="/Xi Jinping">Xi Jinping</a>, according to a former Russian intelligence officer briefed on the situation. The communications with Putin were reported to be a closely held secret in government, given Musk's involvement in promoting the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump. One person said no alerts were raised by the US government, noting the dilemma of the government being dependent on Musk's technologies. Democrat lawmakers and NASA administrator <a href="/Bill Nelson">Bill Nelson</a> stated that it should be investigated to find out if the report was accurate. "We should investigate what Elon Musk is up to to make sure that it is not to the detriment of the national security of the United States", elaborated Representative <a href="/Adam Smith (Washington politician)">Adam Smith</a>. SpaceX officially responded via their X account stating, "Starlink is not available [in Taiwan] because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate, and regulators declined to remove a requirement that a foreign entity own 51% of Starlink to operate there. SpaceX has not accepted such a condition for any market in which it operates."
<h2> Accusations of antisemitism </h2>
Civil rights group, <a href="/Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a>, and several media outlets have accused Musk of sowing <a href="/antisemitism">antisemitism</a> due to his promotion of <a href="/George Soros conspiracy theories">George Soros conspiracy theories</a>, although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.
On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase "Hitler was right"; Weber captioned the video: "To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces." In response, a second user posted "Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of <a href="/Dialectic">dialectical</a> hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is." To the latter user, Musk replied, "You have said the actual truth." He added, "You right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL."
The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing <a href="/white nationalist">white nationalist</a> sentiments and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push "hatred against Whites". The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting <a href="/white pride">white pride</a>. Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets. 
At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from <a href="/The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a> CEO <a href="/Bob Iger">Bob Iger</a> explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist <a href="/Andrew Ross Sorkin">Andrew Ross Sorkin</a> questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, "I hope they stop. Don't advertise" and "If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is"; Musk singled out Iger, saying, "Hey Bob, if you're in the audience." Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying, "I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry." Musk described his tweet as "one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done".
In January 2024, Musk visited the <a href="/Auschwitz concentration camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> with European Jewish Association Chairman <a href="/Rabbi">Rabbi</a> Menachem Margolin, conservative political commentator <a href="/Ben Shapiro">Ben Shapiro</a> and Holocaust survivor <a href="/Gidon Lev">Gidon Lev</a>. He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism. <i>The New York Times</i> described the trip as a part of an image "rehabilitation tour".
<h2>COVID-19</h2>
Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the <a href="/COVID-19 pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. He spread <a href="/COVID-19 misinformation">misinformation about the virus</a>, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of <a href="/list of unproven methods against COVID-19#Use of existing medications unproven against COVID-19">chloroquine</a> and claiming that <a href="/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> death statistics were inflated.
In March 2020, Musk stated, "The coronavirus panic is dumb." In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a "specific form of the <a href="/common cold">common cold</a>" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the US population. Musk also <a href="/Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children">falsely</a> stated that children "are essentially immune" to COVID-19.
Musk condemned <a href="/COVID-19 lockdowns">COVID-19 lockdowns</a> and initially refused to close the <a href="/Tesla Fremont Factory">Tesla Fremont Factory</a> in March 2020, defying the local <a href="/shelter-in-place">shelter-in-place</a> order. In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local <a href="/stay-at-home order">stay-at-home order</a>, In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former <a href="/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a> director <a href="/Anthony Fauci">Anthony Fauci</a>.
In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make <a href="/ventilators">ventilators</a> for COVID-19 patients if there were a <a href="/Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic#Mechanical ventilation">shortage</a>. After figures such as New York City mayor <a href="/Bill de Blasio">Bill de Blasio</a> responded to Musk's offer, Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.
In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the <a href="/COVID-19 vaccine">COVID-19 vaccine</a>, because he and his children were "not at risk for COVID". Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his <a href="/COVID-19 rapid antigen test">COVID-19 rapid antigen test</a> results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results. Following this, a <a href="/postdoctoral fellow">postdoctoral fellow</a> at the <a href="/Princess Margaret Cancer Centre">Princess Margaret Cancer Centre</a> in Toronto explained in a <a href="/Twitter">Tweet</a> why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as "Space <a href="/Karen (slang)">Karen</a>", which then <a href="/Twitter trends">trended on Twitter</a>. In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was "unequivocal" but expressing his opposition to COVID <a href="/vaccine mandate">vaccine mandate</a>s.
<h1>Personal life</h1>
Musk became a US citizen in 2002. From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. He then relocated to <a href="/Boca Chica, Texas">Boca Chica, Texas</a>, saying that California had become "complacent" about its economic success. While hosting <i><a href="/Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> in 2021, Musk stated that he has <a href="/Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, although he has never been medically diagnosed. 
Musk trained in <a href="/Brazilian jiu-jitsu">Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg. In his leisure time, he plays video games including <a href="/Quake (series)"><i>Quake</i></a>, <i><a href="/Diablo IV">Diablo IV</a></i>, <i><a href="/Elden Ring">Elden Ring</a></i>, and <a href="/The Battle of Polytopia"><i>Polytopia</i></a>. Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed <a href="/ketamine">ketamine</a> for occasional depression and that he uses it "once every other week", while <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.
<h2>Relationships and children</h2>
Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased. He met his first wife, Canadian author <a href="/Justine Wilson">Justine Wilson</a>, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000. In 2002, their first child died of <a href="/sudden infant death syndrome">sudden infant death syndrome</a> at the age of 10 weeks. After the baby's death, the couple used <a href="/In vitro fertilisation">in vitro fertilization</a> (IVF) to continue their family; they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.
In 2022, the elder twin officially <a href="/name change">changed her name</a> to Vivian Jenna Wilson, Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the <i><a href="/Financial Times">Financial Times</a></i> characterized as "the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by <a href="/Neo-Marxism">neo-Marxists</a>", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to "destroy the <a href="/woke mind virus">woke mind virus</a>". In a July 2024 episode of <a href="/Jordan Peterson">Jordan Peterson</a>'s podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had "lost [his] son, essentially" because of <a href="/gender-affirming care">gender-affirming care</a>. He commented: "You know, they call it <a href="/deadnaming">deadnaming</a> for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead", again referring to the "woke mind virus," stating that Vivian "is dead, killed by the woke mind virus". Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; saying that Musk was "cold", "quick to anger", "uncaring and narcissistic", and that his infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine. On November 7, 2024, in response to a news article about his daughter's reaction to Trump's election, Elon Musk repeated "the woke mind virus killed my son."
In 2008, Musk began dating English actress <a href="/Talulah Riley">Talulah Riley</a>. They married two years later at <a href="/Dornoch Cathedral">Dornoch Cathedral</a> in Scotland. In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year. Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016. Musk then dated <a href="/Amber Heard">Amber Heard</a> for several months in 2017; he had reportedly been "pursuing" her since 2012.
In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician <a href="/Grimes">Grimes</a> said that they were dating. Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020. Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name "X Æ A-12", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet, which they then changed to "X Æ A-Xii". They have received criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce.
In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via <a href="/surrogacy">surrogacy</a>. Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview with <a href="/Time (magazine)"><i>Time</i></a> in December 2021, he said he was single. In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: "I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid." In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son. In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.
In July 2022, <i>Insider</i> published court documents revealing that Musk had twins via <a href="/In vitro fertilisation">IVF</a> with <a href="/Shivon Zilis">Shivon Zilis</a>, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021. They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news "raise[d] questions about workplace ethics", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk. Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy. Musk denied the report. Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress <a href="/Natasha Bassett">Natasha Bassett</a>, who has been described as "an occasional girlfriend". In October 2024, <i>The New York Times</i> reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and the mothers of his children.
<h2> Legal matters after 2020 </h2>
In May 2022, <i><a href="/Business Insider">Business Insider</a></i> cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in <a href="/sexual misconduct">sexual misconduct</a> in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims. Musk responded, "If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light." He accused the article from <i>Business Insider</i> of being a "politically motivated hit piece". After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%, and <i><a href="/Barron's (newspaper)">Barrons</a></i> wrote of the fall that "some investors considered <a href="/key person insurance">key-man risk</a> – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual."
In April 2023, the government of the <a href="/U.S. Virgin Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a> sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that <a href="/JPMorgan Chase">JPMorgan Chase</a> profited from <a href="/Jeffrey Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>'s sex trafficking operation.
Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children. On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.
Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a <a href="/defamation">defamation</a> lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1&nbsp;million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant "in a violent street brawl on behalf of a <a href="/Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a> extremist group" near <a href="/Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that "Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a '<a href="/false flag">false flag</a>' operation to deceive the American public". In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit. In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.
In October 2023, the <a href="/U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022. Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him. 
In January 2024, Delaware Judge <a href="/Kathaleen McCormick">Kathaleen McCormick</a> ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55&nbsp;billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded. McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board "an unfathomable sum" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware." A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, although much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed "coercive tactics" to move the vote in his favor.
In June 2024, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> reported Musk had a "romantic relationship" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to "have his babies".
