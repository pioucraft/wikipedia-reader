The <b>Northwest Territories</b> is a federal <a href="/provinces and territories of Canada">territory of Canada</a>. At a land area of approximately  and a 2021 census population of 41,070, it is the second-largest and the most populous of <a href="/Provinces and territories of Canada#Territories">the three territories</a> in <a href="/Northern Canada">Northern Canada</a>. Since 1870, the territory has been divided four times to create new provinces and territories or enlarge existing ones. Its current borders date from April 1, 1999, when the territory's size was decreased again by the creation of a new territory of <a href="/Nunavut">Nunavut</a> to the east, through the <i><a href="/Nunavut Act">Nunavut Act</a></i> and the <a href="/Nunavut Land Claims Agreement">Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</a>. While Nunavut is mostly <a href="/Arctic">Arctic</a> <a href="/tundra">tundra</a>, the Northwest Territories has a slightly warmer climate and is both <a href="/Taiga">boreal forest (taiga)</a> and <a href="/tundra">tundra</a>, and its most northern regions form part of the <a href="/Arctic Archipelago">Arctic Archipelago</a>.
The Northwest Territories has the most interprovincial and inter-territorial land borders among all provinces and territories of Canada. It is bordered by the territories of <a href="/Nunavut">Nunavut</a> to the east and <a href="/Yukon">Yukon</a> to the west, and by the provinces of <a href="/British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="/Alberta">Alberta</a>, and <a href="/Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> to the south; it also touches <a href="/Manitoba">Manitoba</a> to the southeast at a <a href="/Four corners (Canada)">quadripoint</a> that includes Nunavut and Saskatchewan. The land area of the Northwest Territories is roughly equal to that of France, Portugal and Spain combined, although its overall area is even larger because of its vast lakes.
<h1>Name</h1>
The name was originally descriptive, adopted by the <a href="/Government of the United Kingdom">British government</a> during the <a href="/Early modern period">colonial era</a> to indicate where it lay in relation to the rest of <a href="/Rupert's Land">Rupert's Land</a>. It has been shortened from <i>North-Western Territory</i> and then <i>North-West Territories</i>.
In <a href="/Inuktitut">Inuktitut</a>, the Northwest Territories are referred to as  (<a href="/Inuktitut syllabics">Inuktitut syllabics</a> ᓄᓇᑦᓯᐊᖅ), "beautiful land".

Since the Yukon Territory was split from it in 1898, it is no longer the westernmost territory, and until <a href="/Nunavut">Nunavut</a> was split from it in 1999 it included territory extending as far east as <a href="/Atlantic Canada">Canada's Atlantic provinces</a>. There has been some discussion of changing the name, possibly to a term from an Indigenous language. One proposal was "Denendeh", as advocated by the former premier <a href="/Stephen Kakfwi">Stephen Kakfwi</a>, among others. One of the most popular proposals for a new name—to name the territory "Bob"—began as a <a href="/prank">prank</a>, but for a while it was at or near the top in the <a href="/opinion poll">public-opinion polls</a>.

<h1>History</h1>
 <a href="/Inuvialuit Settlement Region">Inuvialuit Settlement Region</a> (<i>Inuvialuit Nunangit Sannaiqtuaq</i>), and both <a href="/Métis">Métis</a> and <a href="/Plains Cree people">Nêhiyawak</a> countries (Michif Piyii and ᓀᐦᐃᔮᓈᕁ <i>nêhiýânâhk</i>, respectively). Of these, Denendeh and <a href="/Dene">the Dene nations</a> are the most prominent with the rest of the Dene country ("Dene-ndeh" or Deneland) covering much of what is now <a href="/Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="/British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and the northern regions of the <a href="/prairie provinces">prairie provinces</a>. Some of its constituent territories include <a href="/Tłı̨chǫ Government">Tłı̨chǫ Country</a>, <a href="/Sahtu Region">Got'iné Néné</a>, <a href="/Dehcho Region">Dehchondéh</a>, and <a href="/Gwichʼin">Gwichʼin</a> Nành, amongst others including those of the <a href="/Chipewyan">Dënë Sųłinë́</a> (Nëné, ), <a href="/Dane-zaa">Dane-z̲aa</a> (Nanéʔ), and the <a href="/Yellowknives">T'satsąot'ınę</a> (Ndé). Historically, Dene have lived across Denendeh and what is now the NWT since <a href="/time immemorial">time immemorial</a> and the era of <a href="/Canadian Indigenous law#Dene">Yamoria and Yamozha</a>.
Along the northern coast live one of the <a href="/Inuit">Inuit</a> sudivisions: the <a href="/Inuvialuit">Inuvialuit</a>, a conglomerate of several Inuvialuit peoples, including the <a href="/Uummarmiut">Uummarmiut</a>, <a href="/Kangiryuarmiut">Kangiryuarmiut</a>, and <a href="/Siglit">Siglit</a>. Their country, variously called <i>Inuvialuit Nunangit</i>, <i>Inuvialuit Nunungat</i>, or <i>Inuvialuit Nunangat</i> corresponds to the <a href="/Inuvialuit Settlement Region">Inuvialuit Settlement Region</a> and belongs to the greater <a href="/Inuit Nunangat">Inuit Nunangat</a>. Amongst the other Inuit, there are also the <a href="/Copper Inuit">Copper Inuit</a> who inhabit their traditional territory, <i>Inuinnait Nunangat</i>, between the <a href="/Kitikmeot Region">Kitikmeot</a> and <a href="/Inuvik Region">Inuvik Region</a>s. To the south are the <a href="/Cree">Cree</a> <a href="/First Nations in Canada">First Nations</a> and <a href="/Métis">Métis</a>.
In 1670, the <a href="/Hudson's Bay Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> (HBC) was formed from a royal charter, and was granted a commercial monopoly over <a href="/Rupert's Land">Rupert's Land</a>. Present day Northwest Territories laid northwest of Rupert's Land, and was known as the <a href="/North-Western Territory">North-Western Territory</a>. Although not formally part of Rupert's Land, the HBC made regular use of the region as a part of its trading area. The <a href="/Treaty of Utrecht (1713)">Treaty of Utrecht</a> saw the British become the only European power with practical access to the <a href="/North-Western Territory">North-Western Territory</a>, with the French surrendering their claim to the Hudson Bay coast.
Europeans have visited the region for the purposes of <a href="/North American fur trade">fur trading</a>, and exploration for new trade routes, including the <a href="/Northwest Passage">Northwest Passage</a>. Arctic expeditions launched in the 19th century include the <a href="/Coppermine expedition">Coppermine expedition</a>.
In 1867, the first <a href="/Canadian Indian residential school system">Canadian residential school</a> opened in the region in Fort Resolution. The opening of the school was followed by several others in regions across the territory, thus contributing to it reaching the highest percentage of students in residential schools compared to other area in Canada.
The present-day territory came under the authority of the <a href="/Government of Canada">Government of Canada</a> in July 1870, after the <a href="/Hudson's Bay Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> transferred <a href="/Rupert's Land">Rupert's Land</a> and the <a href="/North-Western Territory">North-Western Territory</a> to the British Crown, which subsequently transferred them to Canada, giving it the name the North-West Territories. This immense region comprised all of today's Canada except British Columbia, an early form of <a href="/Manitoba">Manitoba</a> (a small square area around <a href="/Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>), early forms of present-day Ontario and Quebec (the coast of the <a href="/Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, the <a href="/Saint Lawrence River">Saint Lawrence River</a> valley and the southern third of modern <a href="/Quebec">Quebec</a>), the <a href="/Maritimes">Maritimes</a> (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick), <a href="/Newfoundland (island)">Newfoundland</a>, the <a href="/Labrador">Labrador</a> coast, and the <a href="/British Arctic Territories">Arctic Islands</a> (except the southern half of <a href="/Baffin Island">Baffin Island</a>).
After the 1870 transfer, some of the North-West Territories was whittled away. The province of <a href="/Manitoba">Manitoba</a> was enlarged in 1881 to a rectangular region composing the modern province's south. By the time British Columbia joined Confederation on July 20, 1871, it had already (1866) been granted the portion of North-Western Territory south of <a href="/60th parallel north">60 degrees north</a> and west of <a href="/120th meridian west">120 degrees west</a>, an area that comprised most of the <a href="/Stickeen Territories">Stickeen Territories</a> (and a portion of the Peace River country).
The North-West Territories Council was created in 1875 for more local government in the North-West Territories. At first wholly made up of appointed members, it got its first elected members in 1882 and became wholly elected in 1888 when the council was reorganized as the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. <a href="/Frederick Haultain">Frederick Haultain</a>, an Ontario lawyer who practised at Fort Macleod from 1884, became its chairman in 1891 and Premier when the Assembly was reorganized in 1897. The modern provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were created in 1905. Contemporary records show Haultain recommended that the NWT become a single province, named Buffalo, but the Canadian government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier acted otherwise.
In the meantime, the <a href="/British Arctic Territories">British Arctic Territories</a> were transferred to Canada and added to the North-West Territories in 1880. The province of <a href="/Ontario">Ontario</a> was enlarged north-westward in 1882. Quebec was also extended northwards in 1898. Yukon was also made a separate territory that year and eventually gained additional territorial powers with the 2003 <i><a href="/Yukon Act">Yukon Act</a></i>. One year after the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905, the <a href="/Parliament of Canada">Parliament of Canada</a> renamed the "North-West Territories" as the <i>Northwest Territories</i>, dropping all <a href="/hyphen">hyphen</a>ated forms of it.
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec acquired the last addition to their modern landmass from the Northwest Territories in 1912. This left only the districts of <a href="/District of Mackenzie">Mackenzie</a>, <a href="/District of Franklin">Franklin</a> (which absorbed the remnants of <a href="/District of Ungava">Ungava</a> in 1920) and <a href="/Keewatin Region">Keewatin</a> within what was then given the name Northwest Territories. In 1925, the boundaries of the Northwest Territories were extended all the way to the <a href="/North Pole">North Pole</a> on the <a href="/sector principle">sector principle</a>, vastly expanding its territory onto the northern <a href="/ice cap">ice cap</a>. Between 1925 and 1999, the Northwest Territories covered a land area of —larger than one-third of Canada in terms of area.
On April 1, 1999, a separate <a href="/Nunavut">Nunavut</a> territory was formed from the eastern Northwest Territories to represent the Inuit.
<h1>Demography</h1>
The NWT is one of two jurisdictions in Canada – Nunavut being the other – where <a href="/Aboriginal peoples in Canada">Indigenous peoples</a> are in the majority, constituting 50.4% of the population.

<h2>Language</h2>
French was made an official language in 1877 by the then-territorial government. After a lengthy and bitter debate resulting from a <a href="/speech from the throne">speech from the throne</a> in 1888 by <a href="/List of lieutenant governors of the Northwest Territories">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="/Joseph Royal">Joseph Royal</a>, the members of the time voted on more than one occasion to nullify this and make English the only language used in the assembly. After some conflict with the Confederation Government in <a href="/Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, and a decisive vote on January 19, 1892, the assembly members voted for an English-only territory.
Currently, the Northwest Territories' <i>Official Languages Act</i> recognizes the following eleven <a href="/official language">official language</a>s:
<ul>
<li><a href="/Chipewyan language">Chipewyan/Dené</a></li>
<li><a href="/Cree language">Cree</a></li>
<li><a href="/Canadian English">English</a></li>
<li><a href="/Canadian French">French</a></li>
<li><a href="/Gwich’in language">Gwich’in</a></li>
<li><a href="/Inuinnaqtun">Inuinnaqtun</a></li>
<li><a href="/Inuktitut">Inuktitut</a></li>
<li><a href="/Inuvialuktun">Inuvialuktun</a></li>

<li><a href="/Slavey language">South Slavey</a></li>
<li><a href="/Dogrib language">Tłı̨chǫ</a> (Dogrib)</li>
</ul>

NWT residents have a right to use any of the above languages in a territorial court, and in the debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, the laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the <a href="/Politics of the Northwest Territories">NWT government</a> only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is a significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practical terms, English language services are universally available, and there is no guarantee that other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service, except for the courts.
The 2016 census returns showed a population of 41,786. Of the 40,565 singular responses to the census question regarding each inhabitant's "mother tongue", the most reported languages were the following (italics indicate an official language of the NWT):

<h1>Government</h1>
As a territory, the NWT has fewer rights than the provinces. During his term, Premier Kakfwi pushed to have the federal government accord more rights to the territory, including having a greater share of the returns from the territory's natural resources go to the territory. Devolution of powers to the territory was an issue in the <a href="/Northwest Territories general election, 2003">20th general election</a> in 2003, and has been ever since the territory began electing members in 1881.
The <a href="/Commissioner#Canadian territories">Commissioner</a> of the NWT is the chief executive and is appointed by the <a href="/Governor General of Canada#Constitutional role">Governor-in-Council of Canada</a> on the recommendation of the federal <a href="/Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development (Canada)">Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</a>. The position used to be more administrative and governmental, but with the devolution of more powers to the elected assembly since 1967, the position has become symbolic. The commissioner had full governmental powers until 1980 when the territories were given greater self-government. The legislative assembly then began electing a cabinet and <i>government leader</i>, later known as the <a href="/Premier (Canada)">premier</a>. Since 1985 the commissioner no longer chairs meetings of the <a href="/Executive Council of the Northwest Territories">executive council</a> (or cabinet), and the federal government has instructed commissioners to behave like a provincial <a href="/Lieutenant governor (Canada)">lieutenant governor</a>. Unlike lieutenant governors, the <a href="/Commissioners of the Northwest Territories">Commissioner of the Northwest Territories</a> is not a formal representative of the <a href="/Monarchy of Canada">King of Canada</a>.
Unlike provincial governments and the government of Yukon, the government of the Northwest Territories does not have political parties. It never has had political parties except for the period between 1898 and 1905. Its <a href="/Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories">legislative assembly</a> operates through the <a href="/Consensus government in Canada">consensus government</a> model.
The website of the NWT government describes consensus government thusly:
"The Northwest Territories is one of only two jurisdictions in Canada with a consensus system of government instead of one based on party politics. In our system, all Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) are elected as independents. Shortly after the election, all Members meet as a Caucus to set priorities for that Assembly. The Caucus remains active throughout their term as the forum where all Members meet as equals.[...]
Compared to the party system, there is much more communication between Regular Members and Cabinet. All legislation, major policies, and proposed budgets pass through the Regular Members' standing committees before coming to the House."
The NWT Legislative Assembly is composed of one member elected from each of the nineteen constituencies. After <a href="/List of Northwest Territories general elections">each general election</a>, the new assembly elects the <a href="/Premier of the Northwest Territories">premier</a> and the <a href="/Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories">speaker</a> by secret ballot. Seven MLAs are also chosen as cabinet ministers, with the remainder forming the opposition.
The membership of the <a href="/20th Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly">current legislative assembly</a> was set by the <a href="/2023 Northwest Territories general election">2023 Northwest Territories general election</a> on November 14, 2023. <a href="/R.J. Simpson">R.J. Simpson</a> was selected as the new premier by his fellow MLAs on December 7, 2023.
The member of Parliament for the <a href="/Northwest Territories (electoral district)">Northwest Territories</a> is <a href="/Michael McLeod (politician)">Michael McLeod</a> (<a href="/Liberal Party (Canada)">Liberal Party</a>). The Commissioner of the Northwest Territories is <a href="/Gerald Kisoun">Gerald Kisoun</a>.
In the <a href="/Parliament of Canada">Parliament of Canada</a>, the NWT comprises a single <a href="/Canadian Senate divisions">Senate division</a> and a single <a href="/Electoral district (Canada)">House of Commons electoral district</a>, titled <a href="/Northwest Territories (electoral district)">Northwest Territories</a> (<i>Western Arctic</i> until 2014). Thus a single MP represents an area that is almost 14 percent of the land area of all of Canada.

<h1>Culture</h1>
Aboriginal issues in the Northwest Territories include the fate of the <a href="/Dene">Dene</a> who, in the 1940s, were employed to carry radioactive uranium ore from the mines on Great Bear Lake. Of the thirty plus miners who worked at the <a href="/Port Radium, Northwest Territories">Port Radium</a> site, at least fourteen have died due to various forms of cancer. A study was done in the community of <a href="/Deline">Deline</a>, called <i>A Village of Widows</i> by <a href="/Cindy Kenny-Gilday">Cindy Kenny-Gilday</a>, which indicated that the number of people involved were too small to be able to confirm or deny a link.
There has been racial tension based on a history of <a href="/Bloody Falls Massacre">violent conflict between the Dene and the Inuit</a>, who have now taken recent steps towards reconciliation.
Land claims in the NWT began with the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed on June 5, 1984. It was the first Land Claim signed in the Territory, and the second in Canada. It culminated with the creation of the Inuit homeland of Nunavut, the result of the <a href="/Nunavut Land Claims Agreement">Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</a>, the largest land claim in Canadian history.
Another land claims agreement with the <a href="/Tłı̨chǫ people">Tłı̨chǫ people</a> created a region within the NWT called <a href="/Tlicho Government">Tli Cho</a>, between Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes, which gives the Tłı̨chǫ their own legislative bodies, taxes, resource royalties, and other affairs, though the NWT still maintains control over such areas as health and education. This area includes two of Canada's three diamond mines, at Ekati and Diavik.
<h2>Festivals</h2>
Among the festivals in the region are the <a href="/Great Northern Arts Festival">Great Northern Arts Festival</a>, the <a href="/Snowking Winter Festival">Snowking Winter Festival</a>, <a href="/Folk on the Rocks">Folk on the Rocks</a> music festival in <a href="/Yellowknife">Yellowknife</a>, and <a href="/Rockin the Rocks">Rockin the Rocks</a>.
<h1>Transportation</h1>
<h2>Road</h2>
Northwest Territories has nine numbered highways. The longest is the <a href="/Mackenzie Highway">Mackenzie Highway</a>, which stretches from the <a href="/Alberta Highway 35">Alberta Highway 35</a>'s northern terminus in the south at the Alberta – Northwest Territories border at the 60th parallel to <a href="/Wrigley, Northwest Territories">Wrigley, Northwest Territories</a> in the north. <a href="/Ice road">Ice road</a>s and <a href="/winter road">winter road</a>s are also prominent and provide road access in winter to towns and mines which would otherwise be <a href="/Remote and isolated community">fly-in locations</a>. <a href="/Yellowknife Highway">Yellowknife Highway</a> branches out from Mackenzie Highway and connects it to Yellowknife. <a href="/Dempster Highway">Dempster Highway</a> is the continuation of <a href="/Klondike Highway">Klondike Highway</a>. It starts just west of <a href="/Dawson City">Dawson City</a>, Yukon, and continues east for over  to Inuvik. As of 2017, the all-season <a href="/Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway">Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway</a> connects Inuvik to communities along the Arctic Ocean as an extension of the Dempster Highway.
Yellowknife did not have an all-season road access to the rest of Canada's highway network until the completion of <a href="/Deh Cho Bridge">Deh Cho Bridge</a> in 2012. Prior to that, traffic relied on ferry service in summer and ice road in winter to cross the <a href="/Mackenzie River">Mackenzie River</a>. This became a problem during spring and fall time when the ice was not thick enough to handle vehicle load but the ferry could not pass through the ice, which would require all goods from fuel to groceries to be airlifted during the transition period.
The Northwest Territories is the only jurisdiction in North America to issue a non rectangular standard licence plate. Instead, the territory issues a licence plate shaped like a polar bear.
<h2>Public transit</h2>
<a href="/Yellowknife Transit">Yellowknife Transit</a> is the <a href="/public transportation">public transportation</a> agency in the city, and is the only transit system within the Northwest Territories.
<h2>Air</h2>
<a href="/Yellowknife Airport">Yellowknife Airport</a> is the largest airport in the territory in terms of aircraft movements and passengers. It is the gateway airport to other destinations within the Northwest Territories. As the airport of the territory capital, it is part of the <a href="/National Airports System">National Airports System</a>. It is the hub of multiple regional airlines. Major airlines serving destinations within Northwest Territories include <a href="/Buffalo Airways">Buffalo Airways</a>, <a href="/Canadian North">Canadian North</a>, <a href="/North-Wright Airways">North-Wright Airways</a>.
