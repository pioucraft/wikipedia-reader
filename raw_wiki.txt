A member of the wealthy South African [[Musk family]], Musk was born in [[Pretoria]] and briefly attended the [[University of Pretoria]]. At the age of 18 he immigrated to Canada, acquiring [[Canadian nationality law|its citizenship]] through his Canadian-born mother, [[Maye Musk|Maye]]. Two years later, he [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in Canada. Musk later transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and received [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degrees]] in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend [[Stanford University]] but never enrolled in classes, and with his brother [[Kimbal Musk|Kimbal]] co-founded the online city guide software company [[Zip2]]. The startup was acquired by [[Compaq]] for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded [[X.com (bank)|X.com]], a [[direct bank]]. X.com merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000 to form [[PayPal]]. In 2002, Musk acquired [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizenship]], and that October [[eBay]] acquired PayPal for $1.5&nbsp;billion. Using $100&nbsp;million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a [[spaceflight]] services company, in 2002. 

In 2004, Musk was an early investor in [[electric vehicle|electric-vehicle]] manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), providing most of the initial financing and assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create [[SolarCity]], a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became [[Tesla Energy]]. In 2013, he proposed a [[hyperloop]] high-speed [[vactrain]] transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit [[artificial intelligence]] research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a [[neurotechnology]] company developing [[brain–computer interfaces]], and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) sued Musk, alleging he falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case, Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20&nbsp;million fine. In 2022, [[acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk|he acquired Twitter]] for $44&nbsp;billion, merged the company into his newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial intelligence company.

Musk's actions and [[Views of Elon Musk|expressed views]] have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including [[Views of Elon Musk#COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 misinformation]], affirming [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Transphobia|transphobic]] comments, and promoting [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. [[Twitter under Elon Musk|His ownership of Twitter]] has been controversial because of large employee layoffs, an [[Twitter under Elon Musk#Increase in hate speech|increase in posts containing hate speech]], [[Twitter under Elon Musk#Handling of misinformation and disinformation|misinformation and disinformation]] on the service, and changes to service features, including [[Twitter Blue verification controversy|verification]]. 

By early 2024, Musk became active in American politics as a vocal and financial supporter of US presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], becoming the largest political donor of the [[2024 United States presidential election|2024 election]]. After winning in November, Trump announced that he had chosen Musk along with [[Vivek Ramaswamy]] to co-lead his planned [[Department of Government Efficiency]] (DOGE) advisory board, which is tasked with removing regulations in order to reduce expenditures and increase government efficiency.

==== Conservative PAC activities ====
In 2022, Musk provided over $50&nbsp;million to fund [[Citizens for Sanity]], a conservative [[political action committee]] (PAC) created by former Trump senior advisor [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Steven Miller]] to finance $93&nbsp;million in advertisements related to [[culture war]] issues. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[OpenSecrets]] reported in October 2024 that some of Musk's donations were routed through [[Building America's Future]], a non-profit organization and the hub of a [[dark money]] network supporting Trump. The organization created "[[Building America's Future#Progress 2028|Progress 2028]]", which promoted misinformation about the agenda of Democratic presidential candidate Harris, and was presented as the left's response to [[Project 2025]],  Musk has also promoted the Fair Election Fund, which is heavily funded by Building America's Future, and offers rewards for evidence of election fraud. That organization is heavily involved in [[America PAC]], which is founded and funded exclusively by Musk.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Haberman |first1=Maggie |last2=Schleifer |first2=Theodore |date=October 15, 2024 |title=Republican Operatives Function as Hidden Hand Behind Pro-Trump Efforts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/elections/trump-money-building-americas-future.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241117093248/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/elections/trump-money-building-americas-future.html |archive-date=November 17, 2024 |access-date=November 19, 2024 |work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Massoglia |first1=Anna |date=October 16, 2024 |title=Pro-Trump dark money network tied to Elon Musk behind fake pro-Harris campaign scheme |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/10/pro-trump-dark-money-network-tied-to-elon-musk-behind-fake-pro-harris-campaign-scheme/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241118071653/https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/10/pro-trump-dark-money-network-tied-to-elon-musk-behind-fake-pro-harris-campaign-scheme/ |archive-date=November 18, 2024 |access-date=November 19, 2024 |publisher=[[OpenSecrets]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Mattioli |first1=Dana |last2=Palazzolo |first2=Joe |last3=Safdar |first3=Khadeeja |date=October 2, 2024 |title=Elon Musk Gave Tens of Millions to Republican Causes Far Earlier Than Previously Known |url=https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-political-donations-stephen-miller-desantis-39464294 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241118100717/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-political-donations-stephen-miller-desantis-39464294 |archive-date=November 18, 2024 |access-date=November 19, 2024 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=July 12, 2024 |title=Musk Donates to Trump, Tapping Vast Fortune to Swing 2024 Race |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/elon-musk-donates-to-trump-tapping-vast-fortune-to-swing-2024-race |access-date=July 13, 2024 |work=Bloomberg.com |language=en |archive-date=July 12, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240712234502/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/elon-musk-donates-to-trump-tapping-vast-fortune-to-swing-2024-race |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Helen |date=July 24, 2024 |title=Elon Musk denies report he will donate $45m a month to Trump Super Pac |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/24/elon-musk-donald-trump-donations-denial-super-pac-america |access-date=August 11, 2024 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In October 2024, a [[Federal Election Commission]] filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75&nbsp;million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72&nbsp;million to support Trump's campaign.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ingram |first=David |date=October 16, 2024 |title=Elon Musk has given nearly $75 million to his pro-Trump super PAC |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/elon-musk-nearly-75-million-trump-super-pac-rcna175639 |access-date=October 16, 2024 |website=NBC News |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=McDaniel |first=Eric |date=October 16, 2024 |title=Elon Musk has given $75 million, so far, to put Donald Trump back in the White House |url=https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/g-s1-28591/elon-musk-donald-trump-america-pac-fec |access-date=October 16, 2024 |work=NPR}}</ref> 

In October 2024, Musk promoted a [[Sweepstake|sweepstakes]] conducted by his America PAC, offering to pay $1&nbsp;million per day to randomly selected registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition pledging support of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendments]]. Within days the [[U.S. Justice Department]] wrote America PAC warning that the sweepstakes might be illegal. Compensating people to register to vote violates federal law, and although registering to vote was not a condition to signing the petition, some legal analysts said the sweepstakes might induce people to register in order to participate. Musk's defenders said signing the petition did not specifically induce people to register, although he had previously said registering voters was one of his goals in Pennsylvania and had begun describing prize winners as America PAC "spokespeople".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Perez |first1=Evan |last2=Rabinowitz |first2=Hannah |last3=Cohen |first3=Marshall |title=Justice Department warns Elon Musk that his $1 million giveaway to registered voters may be illegal |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/elon-musk-justice-department-letter/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=October 23, 2024 |access-date=November 19, 2024 |archive-date=November 13, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241113012517/https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/elon-musk-justice-department-letter/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Schleifer |first1=Theodore |last2=Thrush |first2=Glenn |title=Justice Department Warns Musk That His $1 Million Giveaway Might Be Illegal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/elon-musk-department-of-justice-giveaway.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 22, 2024}}</ref> After receiving the Justice Department's warning, Musk awarded two people $1&nbsp;million each.<ref name="2024Oct25CNN">{{Cite web |last=Cohen |first=Marshall |date=2024-10-25 |title=Elon Musk's super PAC awards $1 million prizes to 2 registered voters, despite DOJ warning |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/25/politics/elon-musk-super-pac-winners-doj-warning/index.html |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> On October 28, Philadelphia District Attorney [[Larry Krasner]], sued Musk and America PAC.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cohen |first=Marshall |date=2024-10-28 |title=Philadelphia DA sues Elon Musk and his super PAC over $1M sweepstakes |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/28/politics/elon-musk-philadelphia-lawsuit/index.html |access-date=2024-10-28 |website=CNN |language=en |archive-date=2024-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241029002038/https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/28/politics/elon-musk-philadelphia-lawsuit/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Although Musk had originally said that the prize would be "randomly" awarded, his lawyer argued that recipients "earn" the money after being "selected based on their suitability to serve as spokesperson for America PAC".

On December 6, 2024, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Musk had donated $277 million to Trump and allied Republicans, making him the single largest individual political donor in the 2024 election and the largest donor since at least 2010, not counting candidates who funded their own campaigns, according to data from OpenSecrets. ''The Post'' described Musk as being referred to by some Republicans as "the [[George Soros|Soros]] of the right".<ref name="Thadani 12062024" />

* Tarnoff, Ben, [https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/01/18/ultra-hardcore-elon-musk-walter-isaacson/ "Ultra Hardcore"] {{subscription required}} (review of [[Walter Isaacson]], ''Elon Musk'', Simon and Schuster, 2023, 670 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp.&nbsp;6, 8, 10. "There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. [[Aristotle]] says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in [[Pretoria]], there was a boy who wanted to be a man." (p.&nbsp;10.)
